Today I set up the monorepo structure for my portfolio platform. I plan to store all my projects here going forward and use the main web page to show off my skills and feats
to potential recruiters. As I continue development on my various projects and portfolio platform I will blog about the process and any challenges I overcome during development.

### Next Steps: 
- Turning the blog into MDX-rendered pages
- Creating a cleaner home page layout
- Designing this projects data model

### Future Goals:
- Next.js portfolio + dev blog
- Self-hosted deployment on Debian (Docker + Cloudflare Tunnel later)
- Project Integration (Bus App, 3D printer monitoring) documented through blog posts
