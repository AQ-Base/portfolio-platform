## First Steps with the 3D Printer

Just a small blog post today to talk about what my plans are for my 3D printer project. I recently got my Creality Ender 3 printer back to working condition after some small
trouble shooting. The printer had been sitting unused for a while, and I needed to recalibrate the bed leveling and clean the nozzle to get it printing again. The current printer has
already got some good upgrades installed and with some upgrades in progress too. 

When I first got the printer I found it a struggle to get a good print right off the bat. With lots of trouble shooting and calibration I was able to get it into a good working
order but as I progress with my studies I found I had not much time to progress with it. However, now I have more free time on my hands I can get this thing back on track and I 
would like to outline some plans I have for this printer.

## Recovery and Debugging

- First step should be to recover the printer to a good working state. This involves checking all the mechanical parts, ensuring the belts are tight, 
and that the extruder is functioning properly. - this is already complete!
- Next I would like to finish installing the current mods I have installed into the machine and get a baseline for printing speed using some tests.

*It is going to be important to establish a baseline in these initial tests for part monitoring, speed, accuracy and volume so we have something to compare against once we start upgrading.*

- Another issue I have is to compare all the tests to the baseline **stock** 3D printer might not be possible as when I moved flat I had unfortunatly lost the part fan cooling duct
for the stock model. However, we might be able to reprint that part as it was only a piece of plastic. Being able to revert back to stock would be extremely useful for testing and 
give a good insight into the range of the upgrades we are about to produce.

## Upgrades
*"Upgrades, people, upgrades!" - Ratchet*

To have a quick chat about what the current upgrades I have installed and what one's are stock vs a couple future upgrades I would like to have.

| Stock Ender | Current Ender | Future Ender |
| ----------- | ------------- | ------------ |
| Creality V4.2.2 Motherboard| Creality V4.2.7 Silent Motherboard| Big Tree Tech SKR Mini E3 V3 |
| Marlin Firmware Version unknown | Marlin Firmware Version unknown | Klipper Firmware with Raspberry Pi |
| Stock cooling fan head/duct | Satsana Fan Duct with Noctua fan (not installed) | More Powerful cooling fans? |
| Stock bed leveling springs | Stock bed leveling springs | Silicon bed level spacers |
| Stock filament holder | Custom filament holder with bearings | Some sort of AMS system? |
| No bed leveling sensor | CR Touch not installed | Bed leveling mesh software |
| Bowden PTFE tube set up | Bowden PTFE tube set up | Direct Drive |
| Stock Bed | Stock Bed (with lots of scratches) | Glass bed vs PEI spring steel |

## Budget and Better Printers

As you can see there are lots of different types of upgrades I own / want to get eventually. But the problem with all these upgrades of course is money, and lots of it if I am not
careful. So to set a strick budget and addressing the elephant in the room let us bring up the Bamboo Lab A1. It is an increadible printer from the reviews i've seen and not only
does it not require hours of tinkering just to get it working correctly it also comes at a price way too close to my stock Ender 3 for comfort.

Going from £209 for the stock A1 and £319 for the A1 with AMS is a hard deal to beat, especially with the built in quality insurance Bamboo provides. When I acquired my stock Ender 3
it came in at £139, which at the time was a very good price, April 2023 I believe. This is perfect as later that year in December the A1 dropped as a better, bigger and 
more reliable 3D printer but after some research it turns out it was launched with a heatbed cable issue and had to be recalled, HA!. I can talk about the difference 
of these two printers all day but for the sake of brevity I will try to some up my budget plan.

Ever heard of the sunk cost fallacy? It might well be an important point while we dive into upgrading our printer. To hopefully avoid this problem I will outlie the budget problem
here:

**Current Printer Price Breakdown:**
- £139 Original Price
- £38 Silent Motherboard Upgrades
- £36 CR Touch
- £24 Noctua Fan Upgrade + Bearings and Buck Converters

> Total price comes to: £237! not to consider rolling costs of filament as well.

**Buying a New Printer Price Breakdown:**
- £209 Bamboo Lab A1
- Shipping - probably free
- £110 AMS - if I want it

> The printer alone is already cheaper than the set up we currently have!

But let's consider what we are really trying to accomplish here. Are we trying to just print stuff? Or do we want to learn about 3D printing along the way. I choose to go down the path
of modifying my own open source 3D printer so I could learn skills to help debug and correct other projects I might have while gaining a valuable tool in the process. For this reason I am
going to give another £100 to the budget for this printer to see if I can get comparable results to the A1!

## TL;DR 
I am giving myself a budget of **£100** to create comparable/ reliable results to the Bamboo Lab A1, I am also allowed to use what ever I already own.
