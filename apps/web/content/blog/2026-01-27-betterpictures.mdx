A small blog post today on the new implementation of the image components!. Before we had a basic implementation of Figure and ImageGrid. These were all helpful
components I could use im my blog .mdx files to make referenecing images easier. Previously before I had created an MdxImage component to modify the basic \<img> that
comes with the MDX compiler. So instead of using their image it was changed to use my MdxImage component which uses Next/Image. This made it easy for attatching images
to blogs as seen below:

```tsx title="On MDX Page"
<img
  src="/images/blog/foo.jpg"
  alt="Normal inline image"
  width="400"
  height="300"
/>
```

```tsx title="Once Compiled"
<Image
    src="/images/blog/foo.jpg"
    alt="Normal inline image"
    width="400"
    height="300"
    style={{ height: "auto" }}
/>
```

I was able to achieve this as the library I used, compileMDX allows us to change certain HTML components like \<img> and override it ourselves. I achieved this by 
registering my mdx component with the MDX compiler, shown here:

```tsx title="Using compileMDX"
components: {
    img: (props) => <MdxImage {...props}/>,
    ...
},
```

This worked out very well as the normal \<img> HTML tag is slow and static by nature and the Next/Image component is responsive and optimised. However, in practise I 
did desire a finer grain control of the way the image is displayed, using the methed outlined above every image is a set size and always displayed inline. When I upgraded
to use Figure and ImageGrid, two more types of image components I implemented that I talked about in the last blog. Both of these also had the problem of control. So that
is when I decided to move to a more adaptable component that I called BlogImage. Using BlogImage I would be able to have more control over how the images are displayed 
along side having caption and credit like before.

<BlogImage
    src="/images/blog/foo.jpg"
    alt="Normal inline image"
    width="400"
    height="300"
    mode="left"
    caption="left image"
/>

<BlogImage
    src="/images/blog/foo.jpg"
    alt="Normal inline image"
    width="400"
    height="300"
    mode="right"
    caption="right image"
/>

<BlogImage
    src="/images/blog/foo.jpg"
    alt="Normal inline image"
    width="400"
    height="300"
    mode="centre"
    caption="centre image"
/>

<BlogImage
    src="/images/blog/test.png"
    alt="Normal inline image"
    width="400"
    height="300"
    mode="wide"
    caption="wide image"
/>
