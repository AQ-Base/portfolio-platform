Today marked some major changes in the website's life. So far we have started with a shell and worked our way up to displaying 
all my projects and all my blogs (dynamically might I add) on the website. With use of Next.js and it's smart routing system made 
it a breeze to create webpages dynamically with slug names for projects and blog posts. I'm sure there is more to come to the Blog 
pages itself such as clickable tags and project headers.

Some problems I ran into would be trying to get the MDX styling to work with tailwind. It was not liking the build in markdown bullet
points and headers but with some research and a new package, [tailwind/typography](https://github.com/tailwindlabs/tailwindcss-typography). 
The markdown ended up working as it should with slightly improved styling.

### Goals Completed Today:
- Dynamically display projects
- Dynamically display blog posts

### Next Steps:
- Create better styling for blog posts
- Filter blog posts by tags and projects
