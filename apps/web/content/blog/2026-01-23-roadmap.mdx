## Why a Roadmap?

Using a roadmap for this project will help guide my development process and ensure that I stay focused on my long term goals.
while this version of the roadmap is not final it will give me a good idea of what i'm going to be working towards. I made sure to
make it intentially flexiable without rigid deadlines so I can adapt as needed. I have also put this version of the roadmap in the 
README.md for easy access and reference.
