# Portfolio Platform

A monorepo for my personal portfolio website and dev blog

## Goals
- Digital CV / portfolio site built with Next.js + TypeScript
- Dev blog stored in Git (MDX/Markdown) to document engineering decisions
- Self-hosted deployment on a Debian home server using Docker and Cloudflare Tunnel (planned)
- Space to showcase projects (Bus Web App, 3D printing monitoring & mods)

## Repo structure
- `apps/web` - Next.js portfolio site
- `apps/bus-app` - Bus web app demo (planned)
- `content/blog` - blog posts (MD/MDX)
- `docs` - technical notes and architecture (planned)

## Development
```bash
cd apps/web
npm run dev
```
